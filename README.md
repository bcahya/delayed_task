# DelayedTask

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `delayed_task` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:delayed_task, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `delayed_task` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:delayed_task]]
    end
    ```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/delayed_task](https://hexdocs.pm/delayed_task).
